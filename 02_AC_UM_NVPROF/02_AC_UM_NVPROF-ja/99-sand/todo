why does the prefetch act the way it does?

start with something more basic and watch how it works, build your way up to get clarity.
write expectations and record results. It could be even that blog post is outdated.

HYPOTHESES

If I sync the device there will be no page faults
  FALSE: There are several reasons
    - second copy is on busy stream, which tf gets deferred
    - more pertinently, copy will return as cpu pages are xfered

If I run the multiple inits in their own streams, they will overlap and there will be fewer page faults
  I actually don't think this is true after all since we can still only be sending one copy at a time


WTF: in the blog post it looks like memPrefetchAsync is being called twice, for the 2 arrays, and that there are no page faults. I must try to duplicate.
